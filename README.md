# PortScan
 Basic Python Port Scanning  - This was created to be used during a college class project. Had to make your own tools for part of the security capstone project.

#Library
Socket & threading

#Options 
Normal or Stealth - Stealth simply makes the scan less aggresive by reducing the thread count and increasing the timeout time. Limits the simultaneous ocnnections and increases timeout to help avoid intrusion detection or anything that may flag rapid connection attemps. Really basic.
